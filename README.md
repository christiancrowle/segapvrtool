# segapvrtool
The SEGA pvr tool from the dreamcast SDK. The source code and a binary was found in a full SDK download, and is useful for creating optimized and small PVR format dreamcast textures. The official PowerVR sdk can't do this, and the source code was available with the original, so I have decided to distribute it here.
